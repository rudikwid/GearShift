Some person inluding me, and you who found this fork, are need an arduino solution to make a gear shift indicator for manual transmission cars.

This designed for manual transmission cars with 6 speed, and mostly consumer cars is only 5 speed, so easy just let 6th position no sensor connected.

The original design by Niqro using TL4095 hall effect sensors, but in my country A3144 is easier to get, reed switches is also possible.

in simulation i used regular push buttons to simulate the sensing effect works, just downloaded and run it in Proteus.

Generally, this is universal design for manual transmission cars, and your tasks to adapt to fit the sensors in your car gear shift cover.

of course you will needed to place and find right position 6 pcs neodyum magnets as sensor triggers.

I hope this simple solution is satisfy for you.

other gearshift indicator project is from MickTheMechanic, but even possible to build, the design is too complex for me.
